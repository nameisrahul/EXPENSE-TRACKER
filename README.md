<h1 align="center">Expense Tracker</h1>
Managing personal finances efficiently has become increasingly important, whether you're saving for a vacation, planning for retirement, or simply trying to stay within a budget, keeping track of expenses is essential. To address this need, I have build an 'Expense Tracker' application using python/Django.

## Project overview
My project 'Expense Tracker' will include the following features:
- User Authentication: Allow users to register, login, and manage their accounts securely.
- Expense Management: Users can add, view, edit, and delete their expenses.
- Expense Categories: Expenses can be categorized for better organization and analysis.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the application is accessible and functional across various devices

## Detailing
To put it simple, I can describe the entire project in seperate segments such as
- Designing the user interface (UI) of the application
- Modeling the Database
- Building the form logic

## Designing the UI
- Step 1: Setting up the project environment such as running python-django commands for creating the project and app by specifying names which will create all the dependencies for the project requirements.
- Step 2: Create a templates folder where we will be storing the html file and css file 
- Step 3: I used codepen/io for the html and css templates and later modified and rewritten the code for the necessary UI part of the website and integrated in the project
- step 4: Once integrated I have created the necessary URL's for template rendering for the application
- step 5: Run the server by pushing the command 'python manage.py runserver' open the generated IP  and the ui part will starts to jump in the web.
