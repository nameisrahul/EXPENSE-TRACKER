<h1 align="center">Expense Tracker</h1>
Managing personal finances efficiently has become increasingly important, whether you're saving for a vacation, planning for retirement, or simply trying to stay within a budget, keeping track of expenses is essential. To address this need, I have build an 'Expense Tracker' application using python/Django.

## Project overview
My project 'Expense Tracker' will include the following features:
- User Authentication: Allow users to register, login, and manage their accounts securely.
- Expense Management: Users can add, view, edit, and delete their expenses.
- Expense Categories: Expenses can be categorized for better organization and analysis.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the application is accessible and functional across various devices
